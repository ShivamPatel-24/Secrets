# Secrets

A web-app which allows user to post their secrets anonymously signing up with their Google and email account.

To practice concepts like:
  1. Security (mongoose-encryption, md5, bcrypt, etc.)
  2. Authentication (oAuth, passport.js, etc.)
  3. Cookies and Cache (sessions, serialize, deserialize, etc.)

Potential future additions:
  1. Sign up using github
  2. Adding more concert layers for registeration (like length of password length) and verification (like if username/email already exist).
